# Carousel App

# Main goal

I've never created a React app from scratch so this was a way for me to make sure I understand all the things related to webpack and babel.
After the basic set up of webpack I wanted to create a simple Carousel App that works for both desktop and mobile screens (finger-swipes).

# Install and get started

```
1- $ git clone https://github.com/fridavbg/carouselApp.git

2- $ cd carouselApp

3 - $ npm i

4 - $ npm start

```

1. Clone repo to your local machine
2. Move into the react app folder
3. Install dependencies with npm
4. Start app server

## Open Browser

Now the app is up and running on http://localhost:8080/

You can choose to look at an image by choosing it's id number on top of the page.
Or just plainly scroll through them all with the scrollbar at the bottom of each image. If you are on a mobile device you can also swipe through them all.

## Upcoming feature

Check out the Arrows branch, where I'm working on some arrow buttons that will give an extra option to scroll through the images.
